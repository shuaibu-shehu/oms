# Oxygen Monitoring System : working on publishing Research Paper


#### Globally, approximately 25 million deaths occur annually due to conditions requiring medical oxygen, yet access remains a critical challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In sub-Saharan Africa, respiratory diseases are a major cause of mortality, exacerbated by insufficient access to reliable and cost-effective oxygen supplies. Despite progress during the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the urgency of this issue, fewer than half of health facilities in LMICs have consistent access to medical oxygen. Efforts like the Global Oxygen Alliance and improved infrastructure are underway, but progress remains uneven, particularly in rural and under-resourced areas. Systemic barriers, including unreliable equipment, inadequate training, and weak distribution networks, underscore the need for comprehensive strategies to integrate sustainable oxygen solutions into healthcare systems

<h4>
  The proposed Oxygen Monitoring System is a cost-effective solution designed to optimize oxygen supply management in healthcare facilities, especially in resource-limited settings. It combines real-time monitoring through sensors like SpO2 and flow meters with machine learning models to forecast oxygen demand while also incorporating manual input for data collection where automation is not feasible. The system features a user-friendly dashboard to visualize trends, predict requirements, and trigger alerts, ensuring efficient and consistent oxygen availability. By reducing waste, preventing shortages, and supporting initiatives like the Global Oxygen Alliance, it addresses critical challenges in oxygen management and enhances operational efficiency in hospitals
